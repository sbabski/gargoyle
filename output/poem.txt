Do and do whatever you tell me where I may
Rouse the blear-eyed world, and her spirits danced.
After hearing a waltz by Bartók but why did I
Kill him? Why? Why? Why? Why?

Why should he die? Why? Why should he
Die and his life, then hurrying, in
The firelight. Foils with buttons broken or lost lay
Heaped on a battle field; red boughs everywhere.
